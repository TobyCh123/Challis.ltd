              <p>The SkiRun cards equate to the run colours on the board (Green, Blue, Red, Black, Grey, 'Chair
                Lift').
                In order to claim a run you must have the correct number of the correct colour to handover on your
                go.
                <br><br> GoggleCards represent all colours and can be used on any run to make up numbres if you do not
                have
                the correct number of the correct colour. <br><br> In order to 'Go Off-Piste (claim a white run) any
                colour
                card can be used, you can handover the correct number of cards of one colour.

              <h5>SkiRoute</h5>
              <p>These are the routes that a player must complete in order to earn points. The points to be gained
                from
                completing that route is shown on the card. <br><br> If a player does not complete that route then that
                point amount is deducted from their score at the end. <br><br> At the beginning of a game a player is
                given
                5 SkiRoute Cards, they must keep a minimum of 3 and can choose to discard or keep the remaining.
                <br><br>
                A
                player may then select more route cards on any of their goes throughout the game. In this instance
                they
                are given 3 card and they can discard up to 2.

              <p>At the beginning of a game each player is given 5 SkiDay cards. <br> These cards fall into two
                catergories:
              <ul>
                <li>Avant: For use on that players go, at the start of their go they can play a card that will
                  impact
                  their go and in some cases the following round(s)</li>
                <li>Apres: For use at the end of the game; once scores are being tallied, players may play
                  appropiate
                  cards to increase their score</li>
              </ul>Cards in a player's possession do not have to be used, they will just be wasted at the end of the
              game.

              <p>There are bus runs to travel between the resort villages; Chinaillon, Le Grand Bornand, St Jean De
                Sixt and Le Clusaz. <br> In order to claim a bus route you must hand over 1 SkiRun card of each colour
                plus a GoggleCard for each bus symbol on the run. You only need 1 ski piece for a bus route, when you
                claim a route sit it on a bus. When all the buses are claimed the run is full. You gain 12 points for
                1-bus runs and 16 points for 3-bus runs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="background-color: azure;">
              <h4>Scoring</h4>
              <p>For each run laid you gain points, these points are indicated on the board and increase with the
                length of the run claimed. <br><br> Keep track throughout the game, moving your board pieces as runs are
                claimed or count it up at the end.</p>

              <h4>Ending the Game</h4>
              <p>When a player lays ski pieces taking them under 3 ski pieces remaining that begins the last round,
                each player has one more turn (including the player who triggered the last round). <br> After gameplay
                ends take it in turns to calculate points earned from runs laid (if you haven't done this as you go),
                and then from routes completed. <br> If playing Full SkiDay version then also play any final cards of
                these if wanted. <br> Winning: The game winner is whoever has the most points at the end of the game.
